# A.K Game Loader
### THIS IS FOR LINUX ONLY
>>> We would appreciate a pull request with a Windows version

### THIS USES UNSAFE EXECUTION
>>> A.K Game Loader uses unsafe execution to launch the 'games'
>>> If you look in the main source file (Loader.py) you can find an unsafe `os.system("./" + executable)`


A.K Game Loader is a simple and open-source game loader

If you are getting the `No module yaml` error, then run `pip install pyyaml`


Same with the `No module tkinter` as ^^above^^, just run `pip install tkinter` instead
